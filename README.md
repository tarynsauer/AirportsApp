# Airports App
This React app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It uses the backend [Travel API](https://github.com/tarynsauer/TravelApi) to provide a directory of Airports, along with nearby accommodations and points of interest.

## Getting Started
To start the app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* create an `.env` file with your API info. (Use `.env.example` as an example.)

### TODOs
* add tests
* deploy to Heroku
